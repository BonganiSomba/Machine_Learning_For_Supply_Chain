# Machine_Learning_For_Supply_Chain
This project is about building a predictive model to estimate lead-time using machine learning. We know in the supply Chain lead-time is important especially to our inventory. In this project, we used the Y variable as a lead-time estimate. We used X1, X2... as a port of origin(country), name of a supplier, ship date, type of items, transport mode and put into a stock date. 
The first step was to use imputation methods to clean our data
for feature selection, we used Lasso Method
We also used misclassification error (1 - accuracy)
Then Cross-validation to check the best model for this
results: We got 85 accuracies using the logistic model.

Unfortunately, I can't disclose the data or provide the data, However, you can use this model with any data of your choice and implement it in your research.
