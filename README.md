# Machine_Learning_For_Supply_Chain


Lead time is one of the most important things in the Supply Chain. We tried different methods to have an accurate lead time prediction. Our solution was to introduce machine learning into our supply chain. 

We used features such as country of origin, supplier, put into a stock date, ship date, and type of product we buy.

We used all those features to build a model that can estimate the lead time.
 Where:
1 - the product is not late
0 - the product is late

after building the models and use cross-validation we realised that the logistic regression was the best with a score of 85%
